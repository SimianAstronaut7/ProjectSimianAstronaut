# Project Goals
We are building the common man's Bloomberg terminal.

This project is heavily influenced by [RoaringKitty](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoaringKitty/videos). It attempts to duplicate and improve on the stock research workflow he demonstrated in his [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2CBcthRVKE) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjWnMcdnlQ&t=3s).

Good data is out there but harder to find for non-professionals. You have to aggregate many sources to get something approaching the picture that a professional has. There's a reason a real Bloomberg terminal costs $24k/year. Everything we create will be free. Bottom line: We're working to creating the best tooling we can for individual investors to research stocks.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/SimianAstronaut7/ProjectSimianAstronaut/wiki) if you have additional questions.

## Getting Started
The current workflow is heavily Chrome based. Please follow the wiki [instructions](https://github.com/SimianAstronaut7/ProjectSimianAstronaut/wiki/Project-Setup) to get started. 

## Disclaimer
I am not a financial professional. I am not endorsing any investment strategy. Personally, I  believe that if effort is invested it is possible to find stocks that have favorable risk/reward profiles. This may or may not be true. It is on individuals to make their own assessments. This project is for educational purposes only. 

This project makes every effort to deliver high quality products, but we do not guarantee that our products are free from defects. Our software is provided “as is," and you use the software at your own risk. We make no warranties as to performance, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or any

TLDR: Use at your own risk. Don't sue me.
