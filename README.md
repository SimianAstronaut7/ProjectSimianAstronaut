# Project Goals
We are building the common man's Bloomberg terminal.

This project is heavily influenced by [RoaringKitty](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoaringKitty/videos). It attempts to duplicate and improve on the stock research workflow he demonstrated in his [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2CBcthRVKE) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjWnMcdnlQ&t=3s).

Good data is out there but harder to find for non-professionals. You have to aggregate many sources to get something approaching the picture that a professional has. There's a reason a real Bloomberg terminal costs $24k/year. Everything we create will be free. Bottom line: We're working to creating the best tooling we can for individual investors to research stocks.

Please see the [FAQ](https://github.com/SimianAstronaut7/Project_Simian_Astronaut/wiki/FAQ) if you have additional questions.

## Getting Started
The current workflow is heavily Chrome based. Please follow the wiki [instructions](https://github.com/SimianAstronaut7/Project_Simian_Astronaut/wiki/Project-Setup) to get started. 

## Disclaimer
I am not a financial professional. I am not endorsing any investment strategy. Personally, I  believe that if effort is invested it is possible to find stocks that have favorable risk/reward profiles. This may or may not be true. It is on individuals to make their own assessments. This project is for educational purposes only.
