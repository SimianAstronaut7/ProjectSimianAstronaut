# Project_Simian_Astronaut
Creating a resource for researching stocks.

This project is heavily influenced by [RoaringKitty](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoaringKitty/videos). It attempts to duplicate and improve on the stock research workflow he demonstrated in his [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2CBcthRVKE) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjWnMcdnlQ&t=3s).

The current workflow is heavily Chrome based. 

## Recommended Extensions

[Bypass-Paywalls](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome)

[TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
Allows for arbitrary JavaScript to be run on a page (we can transform, highlight, scroll, lookup info, etc.)
Primary means of [scripting](https://github.com/SimianAstronaut7/Project_Simian_Astronaut/tree/main/GreaseMonkey) this project is using.
Make sure to only take scripts that you understand from trusted sources as these are powerful (and potentially malicious).

[VideoSpeedController](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)
Allows for fine grained (.1X increment) adjustments of a video's speed on most sites.

[ContextMenuSearch](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/context-menu-search/ocpcmghnefmdhljkoiapafejjohldoga) is used by RK, but I haven't personally used it much. 

## Disclaimer
I am not a financial professional. I am not endorsing any investment strategy. Personally, I  believe that if effort is invested it is possible to find stocks that have favorable risk/reward profiles. This may or may not be true. It is on individuals to make their own assessments. This project is for educational purposes only.
